Less costly: Because technical programs are typically less time-intensive, the cost of tuition is usually significantly less than a community college or university. Some trade schools build the cost of books into tuition, making it even more cost-effective.

Practical practice: Universities tend to take a more theoretical approach, where trade schools focus more on the practical. Technical colleges offer students opportunities to experience what their future workplace might be like. The primary way they do this is by offering internships to their students, which allows them to work in their field and gain some valuable on-the-job training.
